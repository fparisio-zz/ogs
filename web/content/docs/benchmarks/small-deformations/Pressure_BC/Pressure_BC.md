##Problem description

Five different benchmarks are reported in which pressure boundary conditions are tested: an axisymmetric elastic cylinder, a plain strain elastic cylinder, an axisymmetric elastic sphere, a tri-dimensional elastic sphere and an axisymmetric elasto-plastic sphere.
See [this PDF](../pressure_bc.pdf) for detailed problem description.
